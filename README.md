# DeepBurn

## Abstract

Using deep learning to classify burn injuries.

## Introduction

## Related Work

There is surprisingly very little research on burn wound analysis and classification with very little data.
The most advanced work found so far is from the CS231N course at Stanford (reference 4).

## Data

* BURNED dataset from Santa Clara Valley / Stanford paper (need to check)
* Internet image search
* Cooperation to be set up

As a first step, the images need to be labeled with the burn degree. 
In a second step the data needs to be labeled with the semantic segmantation information about the burn degree.

## Methods

### Classification with Transfer Learning

Based on literature research, so far there is no work that used transfer learning to do classification of burn wounds.

The basic idea is to take an ImageNet pre-trained network and do transfer learning, by replacing the last layers.

In a first step, we want to do a simple classification of the degree of the burn wound into the (how many?) classes using a softmax as an output.

As burn wounds and their specific image characteristics are not included in ImageNet, it is essential to train the whole network.

We don't have a large database of pictures of the burn wounds, it is a good practise to use data augmentation.

### Object Detection

The methods known in the object detection area are used to identify objects in images. Usually, these are persons, cars, and other objects. The algorithms / networks used are Faster R-CNN or YOLO.
The problem formulation doesn't match really well to the burn wound classification.
However, the extension of object detection to the pixel level by Mask R-CNN bridges the gap to semantic segmentation.
A more detailed explanation of the development of object detection can be found at reference 2.

### Semantic Segmentation

As mentioned in reference 4, it would be a good idea to use Mask R-CNN on this problem.
However, first we need to have the labeled data.

## Problems to solve

### Classification of general burn images

Given a 2D color image, output the maximum (or average) class of burn.

### Classification and spatial outline

Given a 2D color image, ouput the shape of the burn with a pixel level classification of the burn.

### Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Burn Calculation

One o the most interesting metrics for doctors is to get a fast and reliable number on how much skin of the total body is burned to which degree as patient treatment and survival rate depend highly on this number.

### Medical Use Case

Should be smartphone based
