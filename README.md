# DeepBurn

Using deep learning to classify burn injuries

## Methods

### Transfer Learning

The basic idea is to take an ImageNet pre-trained network and do transfer learning, by replacing the last layers.

In a first step, we want to do a simple classification of the degree of the burn wound into the (how many?) classes using a softmax as an output.

As burn wounds and their specific image characteristics are not included in ImageNet, it is essential to train the whole network.

We don't have a large database of pictures of the burn wounds, it is a good practise to use data augmentation.



### Semantic Segmentation

TODO: Want to explore Mask R-CNN
